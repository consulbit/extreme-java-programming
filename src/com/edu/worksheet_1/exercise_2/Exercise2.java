/**
 * <h2>Filtered List using Lambda Expression</h2>
 * <p>
 * In this exercise you are going to create a special <strong>List&lt;E&gt;</strong>  implementation
 * which only accepts elements that satisfy certain criteria. These criteria will be specified at
 * runtime when instantiating the list, by passing a lambda expression at the constructor.
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * a) Create a new class named <strong>FilteredList&lt;E&gt;</strong> that extends
 * <strong>{@link java.util.LinkedList}&lt;E&gt;</strong>.
 * As its constructor argument, the <strong>FilteredList&lt;E&gt;</strong> must take a functional
 * interface whose method takes an element of generic type <strong>E</strong>, and returns true if
 * the element should be accepted by the list, and false otherwise.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Hint:</strong> Java 8 provides a ready-made functional interface for such needs
 * called <strong>Predicate&lt;E&gt;</strong>
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
